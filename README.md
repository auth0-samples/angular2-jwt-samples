# Angular 2 JWT sample apps

This is a repo containing Angular applications that use [angular2-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/angular2-jwt) to attach access tokens to API requests via an [HttpInterceptor](https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpInterceptor).

The goal is to facilitate testing of the angular2-jwt library under different conditions.

## The Samples

[Angular8](/angular8) - Sample built using Angular 8, based on the [Auth0 Angular Quickstart sample](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/angular2)
